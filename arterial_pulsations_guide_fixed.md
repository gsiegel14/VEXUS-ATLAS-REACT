# Key Characteristics of Arterial Pulsations

## Flow Properties
- **Direction:** Flow away from the transducer (typically above baseline)
- **Pattern:** Sharp, high-velocity peaks corresponding to systolic ejection
- **Timing:** Synchronous with cardiac systole, easily distinguished from venous flow
- **Clinical significance:** Confirms anatomical proximity and helps with vessel identification

## Important Note
Focus on the venous waveform (typically below baseline) for VExUS assessment. The arterial signals serve as anatomical landmarks but do not contribute to venous congestion scoring.
