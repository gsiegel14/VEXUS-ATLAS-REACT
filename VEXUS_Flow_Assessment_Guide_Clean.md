# VEXUS Venous Flow Assessment Guide

## Venous Congestion Flow Patterns
Progressive stages from normal drainage to critical congestion

| Congestion Level | Ultrasound Appearance | Pathophysiology | Clinical Significance |
|------------------|----------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Normal Flow | • Smooth, continuous flow<br>• Gentle respiratory variations<br>• No flow interruptions | Blood flows freely back to heart. Normal venous pressure allows efficient drainage. | No Congestion<br>Heart pumping effectively, good organ perfusion |
| Mild Congestion | • More pulsing with heartbeat<br>• Flow slows but doesn't stop<br>• Some backward flow during systole | Heart working harder. Venous pressure rising slightly, early congestion signs. | Early Warning<br>Monitor progression, consider fluid management |
| Moderate Congestion | • Strong pulsing pattern<br>• Flow stops briefly each heartbeat<br>• Clear flow interruptions | Venous pressure significantly elevated. Blood struggling to return to heart. | Significant Congestion<br>Organ function may be affected, intervention likely needed |
| Severe Congestion | • Flow goes backward and forward<br>• Complete flow reversal<br>• "To-and-fro" pattern | Venous system severely overloaded. Blood cannot drain properly from organs. | Critical Congestion<br>High risk of organ damage, urgent treatment required |

## Think of it Like a Drain

**Normal:** Water flows down smoothly

**Mild:** Drain is slightly slow, some gurgling

**Moderate:** Drain backing up, water stops flowing

**Severe:** Water flowing backward out of drain

## Clinical Assessment Value
Why VEXUS matters in patient care

### CVP Estimation
Non-invasive way to estimate central venous pressure without catheters

### Organ Assessment
Identifies which organs are affected by poor venous drainage

### Treatment Guidance
Helps decide if patient needs more fluids or fluid removal (diuretics)

### Risk Stratification
Identifies patients at high risk for acute kidney injury and poor outcomes
